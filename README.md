# Easy-App-Store
Easy App Store (EAS for short) is a App Store for terbowarpian/penguin mod OS's e.g. Arctic OS, with all compatible OS's using MultiDriver C1 (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1163965959) it alows for easy cross platform and OS apps, Seeing that multidriver is built of of InterApp, multidriver is very powerfull. multidiver C1.v2 (coming soon) alows easy acsess to the terminal and file system (if the OS supports it) which alows you to build one App for meny OS's.

# Whats in this repo?
In this repo you will find all the files that you need for EAS (including: Multidriver C1, the EAS client, coming soon!).

# Limits And how to get around them
One of the current limits of EAS is the fact that you can only have -one- sprite installed and downloaded, You CAN get around this by making the sprite a installer that fetches other sprites (I know, its weird for a app store to install a installer, this will be fixed in a future update with pakage lists)

Another limit is desctop and Icon possitioning, this will be solved in Multidriver C1.v2-P/T (Multidriver Column 1 v2 penguin mod and turbowarp edition)

# Good to know
As for now EAS is -Only- for penguin mod so sprite files have to be in a compatible format, e.g. .pms files.
